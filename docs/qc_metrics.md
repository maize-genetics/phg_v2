# Quality Control Metrics

In this document, we will discuss the built-in quality control 
metrics available from the PHG. Metrics accompany several steps
of building and using the PHG, and many can be run as either standalone 
commands or as part of a related command.



## AnchorWave dot plots

[Dot plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(bioinformatics)) 
generated from the [`align-assemblies` step](build_and_load.md#align-assemblies) 
are a visual representation of the alignment between two assemblies. 
They are useful for identifying large-scale structural
differences between assemblies, such as 
[inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_inversion), 
[translocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation), 
and [large deletions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)).

There are three methods to produce AnchorWave dot plots:


**1. As part of the `align-assemblies` command:**

```shell
./phg align-assemblies \
    --gff data/anchors.gff \
    --reference-file output/updated_assemblies/Ref.fa \
    --assemblies data/assemblies_list.txt \
    --total-threads 20 \
    --in-parallel 2 \
    -o output/alignment_files
```

The `align-assemblies` command runs code to create the dot plots 
from AnchorWave's `.anchorspro` files. For each `.anchorspro`
file that is generated, a genome-wide dot plot image is created
and stored in the same location where `.maf` and `.anchorspro` 
files are placed (`-o` parameter directory). Each image that is
generated will have the assembly name found in the `--assemblies`
parameter followed by the suffix, `_dotplot.svg`.
* For example, if your assemblies list file (in my case, this
  would be `assemblies_list.txt`) has the following assemblies
  to align:
  ```
  output/updated_assemblies/LineA.fa
  output/updated_assemblies/LineB.fa
  ```
  The plot output that is generated by default would be:
  ```
  output/alignment_files/LineA_dotplot.svg
  output/alignment_files/LineB_dotplot.svg
  ```

!!! note
    As of PHGv2 version `2.2.74.123`, the plots generated with the 
    `align-assemblies` command are part of the default output and 
    **is not optional**.


**2. As a standalone command:**

```shell
phg create-anchorwave-dotplot \
    --input-file my.anchorspro \
    --output-file myOutputFile.svg
```

The `create-anchorwave-dotplot` command creates a dot plot from 
a user provided `.anchorspro` file generated from AnchorWave. 
Users may use the output from either the `align-assemblies` 
command, or from any user run AnchorWave alignment as the 
`--input-file` parameter to `create-anchorwave-dotplot`.

Output from `create-anchorwave-dotplot` is written to the file 
specified by the `--output-file` parameter. Users may specify 
output files with extension of `.svg` or `.png` and the 
appropriate file type will be generated.


**3. Using `rPHG2`:**

For more "granular" inspection of our alignment data, we can also use 
the complimentary [R package, `rPHG2`](https://rphg2.maizegenetics.net/).
Check out the ["Load and visualize PHG metrics"](https://rphg2.maizegenetics.net/articles/metrics.html)
section for more information.



## VCF metrics

Once the gVCF and hVCF files for the TileDB instances have been 
created, we can produce a table summarizing metrics related to the 
assemblies used to produce them. These metrics are useful for 
identifying low-quality assemblies which you may wish to exclude from 
the PHG, or detecting problems with the assembly alignments.

There are three methods to produce or visualize VCF metrics:

**1. As part of `create-maf-vcf`:**

```shell
phg create-maf-vcf \
    --db-path vcf_dbs \
    --bed output/ref_ranges.bed \
    --reference-file output/updated_assemblies/Ref.fa \
    --maf-dir output/alignment_files \
    -o output/vcf_files \
    --metrics-file output/vcf_files/VCFMetrics.tsv \
    --skip-metrics
```

By default, `create-maf-vcf` will write the VCF metrics table to the 
same output directory as the VCF files (set with flag `-o`) and will 
name the file `VCFMetrics.tsv`. The optional flag `--metrics-file` 
can be used to change the destination of the table. 

If VCF metrics are not desired, the `--skip-metrics` flag can be used 
to skip calculating and writing the metrics table altogether. 
**Generally, we recommend reviewing the built-in QC metrics at each 
step of building the PHG**, so the default behavior is to calculate 
metrics.

**2. As a standalone command:**

```shell
phg calc-vcf-metrics \
    --vcf-dir output/vcf_files \
    --output VCFMetrics.tsv
```

The `calc-vcf-metrics` command creates the VCF metrics table from a 
directory of existing gVCF and hVCF files. It has two required 
parameters:
* `--vcf-dir` - The path to the directory containing assembly VCF 
  files. **gVCF (`.g.vcf`) files are required**, but the 
  corresponding hVCF files are optional.
* `--output` - The name for the output metrics table

!!! note
    `calc-vcf-metrics` **is not a general-purpose tool for VCF files**. 
    It was designed specifically for the files produced by 
    `create-maf-vcf`, which are single-sample, haploid gVCFs and hVCFs.
    Metrics may not be accurate for VCF files that do not fit this 
    format.

**3. Visualize gVCF metrics:**
For more "granular" inspection of our gVCF data, we can also use 
the complimentary [R package, `rPHG2`](https://rphg2.maizegenetics.net/).
Check out the ["Load and visualize PHG metrics"](https://rphg2.maizegenetics.net/articles/metrics.html)
section for more information.


### Output
For each gVCF file in the input directory, both chromosome-level and 
assembly-level statistics are calculated, and each has its own row in 
the table. The columns are as follows:

| Column                     | Description                                                                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `taxa`                     | The sample name in the gVCF file                                                           |
| `chrom`                    | The reference chromosome name. For assembly-level statistics this value is `ALL`           |
| `refLength`                | The length of the reference sequence                                                       |
| `numSNPs`                  | The number of SNP records in the gVCF file for the given chromosome                        |
| `numIns`                   | The number of insertion records in the gVCF file                                           |
| `numDel`                   | The number of deletion records in the gVCF file                                            |
| `numNs`                    | The number of N's/ambiguous bases in the assembly alignment                                |
| `numBasesInserted`         | The number of bases inserted relative to the reference sequence                            |
| `numBasesDeleted`          | The number of bases deleted relative to the reference sequence                             |
| `percentIdentityWithRef`   | The proportion of bases relative to refLength that are the same base as the reference base |
| `percentMappedToRef`       | The proportion of bases relative to refLength that are present in a gVCF record            |
| `meanInsertionSize`        | The mean size of insertion records                                                         |
| `medianInsertionSize`      | The median size of insertion records                                                       |
| `largestInsertion`         | The size of the largest insertion                                                          |
| `meanDeletionSize`         | The mean size of deletion records                                                          |
| `medianDeletionSize`       | The median size of deletion records                                                        |
| `largestDeletion`          | The size of the largest deletion                                                           |
| `refRangesWithHaplotype`   | The number of reference ranges with a non-missing haplotype in the hVCF file               |
| `haplotypesIdenticalToRef` | The number of haplotypes identical to a reference haplotype in the hVCF file               |

The last two columns, `refRangesWithHaplotype` and 
`haplotypesIdenticalToRef` require hVCF files to calculate, and are
omitted if no hVCF files are present in the given directory. See the 
hVCF specification documentation for more details about the hVCF 
format.

### Terminology disambiguation
* `percentIdentityWithRef` is roughly equivalent to the percentage of 
  bases contained in gVCF reference blocks with non-missing 
  genotypes. It also includes the padding base of each indel record 
  if that base is the same as the reference
* `percentMappedToRef` includes reference blocks, SNP records, and 
  indel records. It is equivalent to the percentage of the reference 
  covered by alignment blocks in the AnchorWave MAF files used to 
  create the VCF files
* `refRangesWithHaplotype` In general, most assemblies will produce 
  haplotypes at most reference ranges. However, large deletions may 
  span an entire reference range or more, resulting in a missing 
  range. A large number of missing ranges may indicate a problem with 
  the assembly or the alignment.



## Imputation metrics

> Calculate imputation metrics for an hvcf file created by the Imputation pipeline

**Command** - `imputation-metrics`

**Example**

```shell
phg imputation-metrics \
    --sample-hvcf my/parent/hvcf/from/create-maf-vcf \
    --imputation-hvcf my/imputation/h.vcf \
    --bed-file path/to/ranges.bed \
    --read-mapping-files my/readMappingList.txt \
    --output-file output/imputation_metrics.txt 
```

**Parameters**


| Parameter name         | Description                                                                               | Default value | Required?        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| `--sample-hvcf`        | Path to hvcf for the sample expected to be selected most often.                           | `""`          | :material-check: |
| `--imputation-hvcf`    | Path to hvcf created from imputation pipeline.                                            | `""`          | :material-check: |
| `--bed-file`           | Path to bed file created in create-ranges.                                                | `""`          |                  |
| `--read-mapping-files` | Path to a file that contains a list of read-mapping files, one per line, full path names. | `""`          |                  |
| `--output-file`        | Path to a file where metrics will be printed.                                             | `""`          |                  |
| `--chrom'              | Comma-separated list of contigs to include in output (optional)                           |               |                  |

The `imputation-metrics` command calculates metrics for a given h.vcf file created as the output of find-paths.
It requires input that is not available to the find-paths command, so must be run separately from
that command.

The intent of this command is to provide a way to evaluate the quality of the imputation process.  The metrics
allow the user to see the path the imputation has taken, where it has diverged from the parent (sample)
haplotype, and shows the read counts from the read mappings files that support each transition.
The output is a tab-delimited file with data arranged in reference range order that can be opened in a 
spreadsheet program for further analysis.
